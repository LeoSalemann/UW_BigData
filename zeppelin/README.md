# Zeppelin Notebooks

These files were created during my Big Data Engineering classes with the University of Washington Professional and Continuing Education, Winter/Spring of 2017.  This folder contains [Apache zeppelin](https://zeppelin.apache.org/) notebooks, in json format.

Notes
- Use *Import Note* to load these json files into Zeppelin.
- For Week 2, much of the material prior to slide 33 can be found in the notebook Hello World
- If your Zeppelin notebooks are in folders, you should find Hello World under Getting Started. Otherwise, it will just be at the top-level with everything else.|
